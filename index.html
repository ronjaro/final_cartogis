<h2>Reflection on week 1</h2>
<img src="mapfromweek1.png" alt="A Map" width="300">

<p>My map from week 1 presents the distribution of downy birch in North Karelia and it is a fairly simple map. If I were to redo it, I would add some information of the area it represents. The readings and discussions from week 4 included the idea that maps should display interactions and causality, so I would like to add something to better represent that. If the biggest cities and towns were added, maybe we could see some connection to the areas that have little to no occurrence of downy birch trees (and probably trees in general). Exploring the area even more could result seeing the impact of other human activity like industrial areas and eventually including them in the map.</p>

<p>This course has taught me to consider the purpose and audience of the map. On one hand, a very simple map is easy to understand, but on the other, it may lack content. The map should be created with the audience of the map in mind, who is going to be “reading” it. For my map from week 1 I would like for anyone to be able to understand it, even without knowing the area. That’s why it would be important to have some additional information. As I mentioned in the exercise in week 1, an inset map and a north arrow would give more info where this area is located. I don’t think a basemap would add that much and still maintain the simplicity of the map but maybe adding blue colour to represent the water bodies in this area, filling the empty spaces would offer more explanation. If elements were added, the layout should be considered more carefully. That is also something that I’ve taken more into consideration as a result from this course and would like to practise. I would like to try to make more complex visualizations combining text, image and graphs to a map, and testing out how to achieve good layouts.</p>

<p>Layout is closely related to the visual hierarchy and choosing which elements to highlight. I have found that simplicity is often better, and it’s easy to create a map that’s too complex or busy.  If I try to consider this map from the point of visual hierarchy, choosing what is important and highlighting those features, I would at least change the legend. The legend is a strong and dark colour, which maybe isn’t necessary so muting the colour would be a good idea. I still like the colour scheme, but having green and red isn’t recommended, so I would probably change the legend colour entirely. I could include the red in the title, because it doesn’t affect the readability of the map like the legend does. I would make the title bolder and change the text colour to red instead of it being a background colour. An important point from this course has also been the importance of the decisions of the mapmaker, like the classification and colours. They can change how the information is understood and even distort the data. In this map the classes and their colours were difficult to choose, as well as knowing which is the best representation of reality.</p>

<p>I have also realized during this course that mapmaking can be free and not all maps have to have the same elements. This ties in with the purpose of the map, one should always consider the context where the map is presented and how much it influences or even limits the map itself.

<p style="background-color:Chocolate;"> How this course has affected how I want to create maps in the future:</p>
<ul style="background-color:Chocolate;">
  <li style="background-color:Chocolate;">Explore more ways to do maps, especially considering the layout. I think I’ve had very similar layouts in my maps, and I want to try to add more elements and creating different types of layouts</li>
  <li style="background-color:Chocolate;">Be more creative with the maps I’m making and maybe try some unusual choices just because</li>
  <li style="background-color:Chocolate;">-	Try to be more intentional when making maps and starting with planning on paper. I have found that helpful during this course. Also considering important questions like what purpose does the map have, where will it be displayed and who will be the audience before starting would make the map making process clear and help document the different stages and steps</li>
</ul>
